I'm the one, don't weigh a ton
don't need a gun to get respect up on the street
under the sun the bast*rd son will pop the glock to feed himself and family
by any means, your enemies, my enemies
we wet them up like a canteen
the yellow tape surrounds the fate, don't have a face, so now you late
open the GATES.
